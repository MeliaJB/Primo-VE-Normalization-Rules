        <dc:description xml:lang="en-US">The tremendous Latino growth combined with the challenges of living in a nontraditional migration area make Latinos, particularly those who are undocumented, a “difficult-to-reach” and understudied population in research. We describe the development and practice of an immigrant community research team created to investigate and improve research quality regarding health-related needs, beliefs, and behaviors of recent Latino immigrants living in Cincinnati, Ohio. Our community research team, Latinos Unidos por la Salud (LUSalud), is composed of Latino immigrant community members and academic researchers working in a health research partnership. The community team members are considered “co-researchers” since LU-Salud was designed within a community-based participatory research framework where we engaged in shared decision making at each phase of the research process from design, data collection, and interpretation of findings to dissemination. The co-researcher approach promoted shared decision-making and community empowerment throughout the research process with our community members providing expertise about the “what” (Latino immigrant health-related beliefs and behaviors, questionnaire content, interpretation of data) and the “why” (to obtain perspectives from Latino immigrants who typically don’t engage with academics) and our academic members bringing expertise about the “how” (research design and methods, grant funding).</dc:description>

        <dc:description xml:lang="en-US">"In this article, I highlight the sonic disciplinary regimes that form the backdrop of Paule Marshall’s The Fisher King. Marshall’s final novel chronicles the climax of a generations-long antagonism within a black diasporic family that coalesces around one character’s, Sonny-Rett’s, career as a jazz musician. Sonny-Rett’s exceptional musical talent renders him the target of overlapping regimes of domestic and state regulation and discipline. His alienation from his communities follows the condemnation of jazz in the interwar period as too obscene, flagrant, and undisciplined to have a place in national culture in both the United States and France. By examining the inter- and intra-community fissures that form around the maintenance of a respectable soundscape—and thereby obedient and respectable black subjects—I argue that Marshall calls attention to the soundscape as a critical frontier in struggles to dismantle global anti-blackness. By casting black cultural production as improper and anti-national, black subjects are obliquely targeted for exclusion or extermination under the guise of seemingly neutral regulations that indict music and musical venues rather than subjects.This work underlines Marshall as a forerunner of later Caribbean women writers—such as Erna Brodber and M. NourbeSe Philip—who view decolonization and struggles against anti-blackness as projects that require broad, international black solidarity, rather than solely national or regional affiliation. Sonny Rett’s expulsion from his home, exile from his nation, and death as an expatriate in Paris at the hands of the police signal the pressures of national belonging; conversely, his live performances elicit aural experiences of solidarity with his audience. For Marshall, jazz both links and divides Afro-diasporic communities who grapple with the often-conflicting demands of black middle class respectability and liberatory possibilities of black solidarity.“The Profane Ear” unfolds in three parts: First, I examine how Sonny-Rett is presented as a unique aural subject whose powers of hearing are viewed as both profound and “profane”. Next, through close attention to Sonny Rett’s mother’s home, I show how domestic spaces in the novel become sites of alienation and sonic regulation whose tactics of discipline borrow from military and legal discourses, linking them with the state. Finally, by showing how the linked geographies of New York and Paris in the interwar period enforced similar laws to restrict black jazz musicians, I present Sonny-Rett’s decline and death as exemplary of the link between global anti-blackness and soundscape regulation."</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Standing Our Ground: A Study of Southeast Asian Counterterrorism Conventions Contributing to a Peaceful Existence</dc:title>
    <dc:creator>Hager, Major Dennis</dc:creator>
    <dc:description>Less than a year after the September 11th attacks on New York and Washington D.C., terrorist groups in Southeast Asia carried out a number of high profile attacks in the region. In an area ripe for global terrorism the effects of counter‐terrorism conventions can be measured and the possibility of progress in the global war observed. The regional cooperation inherent in these conventions has been crucial to the success of peace for this region, and is especially significant considering the immense cultural and political differences among these nations.
With fourteen official languages and over 500 million people living in an area that spans the entire economic, religious, and political spectrum, Southeast Asia may very well epitomize the definition of regional diversity. They have a style very different from that of the European Union, but one that may be applicable in Africa, Latin America, or the Middle East.
Maintaining a focus on sovereignty does not equate to a lack of regional or international cooperation. Contrary to some western views this region has proven to be flexible and effective in countering terrorist threats. As terrorists continue to evolve, Southeast Asia is prepared to evolve in ways that will counter new threats.</dc:description>
